## Project Overview

The NerdOverflow forum is a well-defined, fair and civilized web application for academic discussions in different areas. Its purpose is to help people who want to publish their academic opinions in different fields such as programming, biology, math, science, etc. Users can learn, reference, argue or refute from it. Our main goal is to provide our users with a platform where they can share information or expertise for everyone to gain knowledge. To create a purified environment, our administrator checks every flagged post and will be taken down if proved on having offensive content. NerdOverflow does not condone these kinds of behavior and will ban these users.

Users who do not have an account can browse and see posts from our application. However, for them to create one, they must sign in or create an account. Users with an account can create, edit, delete and bookmark a post. These will help them organize the information they want to share and keep. Users who have an account can do all the forumâ€™s features including the use of comment box to exchange thoughts about the post and report the post if they find it hostile or insulting.
